## Highlight  
This project was built **with diploma and branch-change students in mind**.  
Many learners from diverse backgrounds struggle when they enter advanced subjects because they:  
- Don‚Äôt know which resources to refer to 
- Waste a lot of time searching for structured material 
- Lack access to personalized guidance 

To address this, **EduFused** brings together all essential tools ‚Äî a chatbot for real-time doubt solving, adaptive quizzes, and curated learning content ‚Äî into a single platform.  

Our goal is simple: **help students save time, learn smarter, and build confidence in core subjects.**
